# Scraping video views pipeline

I tried to do fully programmatically and had it working for about 3 days, but then it stopped and because I am no web scraping expert, I had to fall back other methods. 

1. Update YouTube video links. Follow steps in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fz7IuCYNN4) until 1:55. Save file (should save as .txt). 

2. Put .txt file into repo and rename to watchLinks.txt

3. Run dailyYouTubeScrape.py
